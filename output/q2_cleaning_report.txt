DATA CLEANING REPORT
====================

Rows before cleaning: 196627

Missing Data Handling:
- Wet Bulb Temperature, Rain Intensity, Total Rain, Precipitation Type, Heading
  Method: Forward-fill (time series appropriate)
  Reason: High non-random sensor-based missingness

- Air Temperature, Barometric Pressure
  Method: Row-wise removal for remaining NaNs
  Reason: Missing rate < 0.1%

Outlier Handling (IQR Method, 3×IQR):
- Air Temperature: capped at [-47.30, 73.10], outliers capped = 0
- Humidity: capped at [-12.00, 149.00], outliers capped = 0
- Wind Speed: capped at [-3.50, 8.40], outliers capped = 2573
- Maximum Wind Speed: capped at [-10.80, 17.20], outliers capped = 220
- Barometric Pressure: capped at [965.00, 1023.80], outliers capped = 106
- Solar Radiation: capped at [-390.00, 520.00], outliers capped = 17387

Duplicates Removed: 0

Data Type Conversions:
- Measurement Timestamp → datetime64[ns]
- Meteorological variables → numeric
